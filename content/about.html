Music
-----

I play electric and upright bass. I've played in a metal band in the past, but
right now my focus is on jazz and blues. I'm taking lessons with a wonderful
teacher and hope to be skilled enough to play at dances and such in the near
future.

I DJ at swing and blues dances fairly often. My taste is pretty broad, and
I'll cater to whatever the floor wants, but I tend to personally enjoy
slightly down-tempo, small-group music. Let me know if you need a DJ for a
dance.

Dancing
-------

I've been swing dancing for about seven years. My first love is Lindy Hop; I
go to classes, workshops and exchanges as often as my schedule and budget will
allow. I also give lessons; I'm not *the* most skilled dancer but I do have
teaching experience and I'm relatively cheap.

I've also been blues dancing for a couple of years. I'm not great at it yet
but I'm getting there. I enjoy it even more than Lindy. My favorite aspect of
dancing in general is connection and blues seems to bring that out more than
any other dance.

Lately I've also started getting my feet wet in tango. Whether it'll ever
become as important to me as blues or Lindy remains to be seen.

Photography
----------

I like photographing people. Other things as well, but especially people.
They're the most interesting subject to me. I tend to gravitate toward the
"art" aspects of photography more than the "journalism" aspects, but I can
appreciate both.

I shoot digital and film (35mm and medium format) depending on my time limits
and mood. I develop film in my bathroom and print it in a rented darkroom.
When I print digital I use a lab nearby; I don't have the money for a
professional printer just yet.

I don't make my living from photography but I do take small jobs.

I post most of what I take on [my Flickr account][Flickr].

Programming
-----------

I graduated from [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://rit.edu/) with a
degree in Computer Science.

I've done a lot of different things in the field so far. Right now the things
that are captivating me are artificial intelligence and clean, simple,
*useful* web applications.

I find programming beautiful. That might sound strange, but there are aspects
of programming and math that I can't describe any other way.

You can take a look at my [projects][] to see the major stuff I've worked on,
or cut to the chase and look at [my BitBucket account][BitBucket].
