A while ago I wrote a [post][vimpost] about switching back to [Vim][].  Since then
I've written two plugins for Vim, one of which has been officially "released".

A couple of people have asked me if I'd write a guide to creating Vim plugins.
I don't feel confident enough to do that yet, but I do have some advice for Vim
plugin authors that might be useful.
